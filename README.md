## Inline formats

Here's an idea: why don't we take `SuperiorProject` and turn it into `**Reasonable** Project`.
`**Reasenable**` cannot be converted into bold text because of the `` double backticks.

## Multiple lines

For multiple lines we use ``` triple backticks.
```
I
love
pancakes
and
cupcakes
```

## Links

Between [] wil be the world displayed.

Between () will be the link refered to.
